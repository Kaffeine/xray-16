* OpenAutomate: https://developer.nvidia.com/openautomate
* NVAPI: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvapi
* libjpeg: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg
  - Use "jpeg" as project root directory name for compatibility with CxImage
* zlib: http://zlib.net
* BugTrap: https://github.com/nitrocaster/BugTrap
* FreeImage: http://freeimage.sourceforge.net
* FreeMagic
* libogg-1.1.4: http://xiph.org/downloads

Setup:
------
- Install S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat
- Install patch 1.6.02 (only for russian locale, worldwide release should have it included):
  http://cop.stalker-game.ru/?page=patches#2
- Download and unpack archive with libraries
- Create _bin_dbg, _bin_mix and _bin_rel folders in the game installation directory
- Copy following files from bin to _bin_dbg, _bin_mix and _bin_rel:
  - dbghelp.dll
  - eax.dll
  - wrap_oal.dll
- Copy following files from bin to _bin_dbg\dedicated, _bin_mix\dedicated and _bin_rel\dedicated:
  - eax.dll
  - wrap_oal.dll
- For _bin_rel and _bin_mix:
  - Copy BugTrap.dll from src\Externals\BugTrap\Bin
- For _bin_dbg:
  - Copy BugTrapD.dll from src\Externals\BugTrap\Bin and rename it to BugTrap.dll
- Copy following files from src\Externals\OpenSSL\bin to _bin_dbg, _bin_mix and _bin_rel:
  - libeay32.dll
  - ssleay32.dll
- Create soft link to /gamedata in the game installation directory:
  $ mklink /D <game installation directory>\gamedata <xray-16 repository root>\res\gamedata  
- After successful build use xrbinup.cmd to update game binaries:
  $ xrbinup.cmd "E:\Program Files (x86)\GSC World Publishing\STALKER-COP" %src% dbg  
- You can create cmd script to update binaries in a single click, for example:
  @echo off
  setlocal
  set src="E:\git\xray-16"
  set dst="E:\Program Files (x86)\GSC World Publishing\STALKER-COP"
  call xrbinup.cmd %dst% %src% dbg
  endlocal

XXX nitrocaster: add script for copying/renaming/soft linking
